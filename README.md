WebSocket Chat Server
This is a simple WebSocket-based chat server implemented using Node.js and the ws library. The server allows multiple users to join specific chat rooms and exchange messages within those rooms.

Features
Join Rooms: Users can join specific chat rooms by sending a join message with a roomId.
Send Messages: Users can send messages, and the server ensures that the messages are broadcast only to users in the same chat room.
